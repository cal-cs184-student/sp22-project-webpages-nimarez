<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>In ClothSim, we used spring equations and the Verlet integration equation to model cloth 
	as a network of springs in order to simulate movement, collision, and a variety of shading techniques.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-triangle-rasterization">Part 1 - Masses and Springs</h2>
<p>In this task, we implemented the "cloth" as a network of structural, shearing, and bending springs. 
	Below, our cloth can be seen with falling from above with two corners pinned in place. The left image occurred earlier in 
	simulation and the right image later.
	</p>

		<img src="images/task1pinned22.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	</div>
<p>Below, the wireframe can be seen with no shearing constraints (only structure and bending), just shearing constraints, and then
	all three types of springs.
</p>

	<img src="images/task1justshearing.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task1allsprings.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  </div>

<h2 id="task-2-supersampling-algorithm">Part 2 - Simulation via Numerical Integration</h2>
<p>In this task, we used the spring force equations derived from the cloth structure as well as the 
	Verlet integration method to simulate the evolution of the cloth over time. Because our simulation is 
	flexible, we were able to see the result of changing various values. 
	 </p>

	 <p>Spring constant: a higher spring constant could be seen to make the model very rigid, 
		 whereas a low spring constant led to the model jiggling around wildly. Below: default ks versus 
		 default / 1000, causing noticeable shimmering in the structure of the cloth.
	 </p>

		<img src="images/task2default.png" height="450" width="600"/>
		<img src="images/task2lowks.png" height="450" width="600"/>
	  </div>

	 <p>Density: the density of the material affects the result of all other forces, so a very high density 
		 leads to more pronounced spring forces and dramatic effects of gravity. A low density, then, resulted in 
		much less perceived force on the cloth. Below: default density and density 1000 times the default, 
	causing continuous motion due to much higher force.</p>

	<div>
		<img src="images/task2default.png" height="450" width="600"/>
		<img src="images/task2highdensity.png" height="450" width="600"/>
	  </div>

	<p>Damping: damping affects how much forces diminish over time, so with a very low damping, the cloth
		continues moving drastically for a long time, but a high damping causes the cloth to come to rest quickly. 
	Below: default damping of 20% versus damping of 0%, causing the cloth to swing backward quickly.</p>

	<div>
		<img src="images/task2default.png" height="450" width="600"/>
		<img src="images/task2lowdamping.png" height="450" width="600"/>
	  </div>

	<p>Below is the resting state of the cloth given the default parameters.</p>

<h2 id="task-3-transforms">Part 3 - Handling Collisions with Other Objects</h2>
<p>In this task, we created methods to handle colliding the cloth and its constituent springs with 
	spherical and planar objects.
</p>

<p> Below, we collided our cloth with sphere using spring coefficients of ks = 500, 5,000, and 50,000. 
	Noticeably, the higher spring coefficients cause the material to rest farther from just due to the effects of 
	gravity, with ks = 50,000 resulting in pronounced angles in between the edges of the cloth and the sphere.

</p>

	<img src="images/task3finalrestingks500.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task3finalrestingks5000.png" height="300" width="400"/>

	<p>Below is our cloth colliding with a plane from above, textured with a picnic table and 
		checkerboard texture.

<p>Below is our cloth colliding with a sphere from above, textured with a picnic table texture and an image of 
	Sam's partner, Catherine, holding a baguette.

	<img src="images/task3sphere1.png" height="300" width="400"/>

</div>

<h2 id="task-4-barycentric-coordinates">Task 4 - Handling Self Collisions</h2>
<p>In this task, we implemented logic so that the cloth wouldn't collide with itself ("clipping"), but would
	instead realistically fold on itself in response to forces. Below are six screenshots of the cloth falling (with 
	normal shading). The cloth first begins to fold at the bottom, then as it has almost entirely hit the ground, 
it starts to really fold over itself, ending up completely folded in half. </p>

	<div>
		<img src="images/task4fall1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
		<img src="images/task4fall2.png" height="300" width="400"/>
		<img src="images/task4fall3.png" height="300" width="400"/>

	  <div>

		<img src="images/task4fall5.png" height="300" width="400"/>
		<img src="images/task4fall6.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	  </div>

	  <p>Density: as before, higher density caused a stronger force on the cloth, resulting 
		  in bounciness, whereas low density caused the cloth to come to a stop earlier. Below: 
		  regular density vs. 100x density, causing the cloth on the right to fall faster.
	  </p>

	  <div>
		<img src="images/task4density1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
		<img src="images/task4density2.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	  </div>

	  <p>Spring constant: a high spring constant led to very rigid movement (structural and other constraint springs 
		  not bending as far in response to the same force), whereas very low spring constant led to the cloth bouncing around wildly. 
		  Below, the left shows a cloth with ks = 1/1000 times the default, and the right shows a cloth with ks = 1000 times 
		  the default.
	  </p>

	  <div>
		<img src="images/task4spring1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
		<img src="images/task4spring2.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	  </div>

<h2 id="task-5-texture-mapping">Task 5 - Shaders</h2>
<p>In this task, we used GLSL to implement a variety of methods of shading objects. For this, we used .vert and .frag files. 
	.vert files allowed us to generalize and parallelize operations over all vertices, and then the outputs
	of these .vert files were used as inputs to .frag files, which used the values relevant to each vertex 
	and a given procedure to calculate the color at that point.
</p>

<p>One of the main shaders, Blinn-Phong, is a clever combination of three kinds of lighting: diffuse, ambient, and specular 
	that approximates real world reflection, global illumination, and shine effectively. Below, the sphere and cloth are shown 
	with just the ambient component, just the diffuse component, just the specular component, and then the whole Blinn-Phong model.
</p>

<div>
	<img src="images/task5blinn1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task5blinn2.png" height="300" width="400"/>

	<img src="images/task5blinn3.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task5blinn4.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  </div>

<p>Another shader type we introduced was the ability to map shaders onto our objects, 
	so below is Sam's partner Catherine holding a baguette mapped onto a falling cloth and a photo of 
	Yosemite mapped onto another cloth.
</p>	

<div>
	<img src="images/task5texture1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task5texture2.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  </div>

  <p> Below, we showcase our bump shading (exterior changes) and displacement shading (physical changes to the 
	  points on the materials) using texture_3, which looks like bricks. 
	Both textures have noticeable shading features due to the layout of the bricks, but the 
displacement shading seems much more 3 dimensional, with the mortar between the bricks being visible. </p>

	  <div>
		<img src="images/task5sphere1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
		<img src="images/task5sphere2.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	  </div>

	  <p>
	   Below, we use the same shaders but change the sphere's coarseness. On the top left is less coarse 
	sphere with displacement shading, and on the top right with a more coarse sphere. The bottom row are the same for bump 
shading. Noticeably, for displacement shading, the more coarse sphere has smoother geometry to land on, where for the bump shading, this 
difference is purely cosmetic.</p>

<div>
	<img src="images/task5displacement16.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task5displacement128.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  </div>

	<img src="images/task5bump128.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  </div>


	<p>Finally, below is the sphere shown with an environnment mapping 
		that mirrors a lovely cube texture.</p>

	<div>
		<img src="images/task5environ1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
		<img src="images/task5environ2.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	  </div>



<h2 id="retrospective-and-thoughts">Retrospective and Takeaways</h2>
<p>Using physics simulation has been really rewarding - all of the key graphical knowledge that 
	we've built up so far (rasterization, meshes, shading, and collision) are able to come together
	in order to produce realistic progression through time. We will continue this kind of simulation for our final project.
