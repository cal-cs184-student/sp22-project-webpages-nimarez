<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>In this project, we implemented Bezier surfaces with de Casteljau subdivision, halfEdgeMesh operations, and 
	the Loop Subdivision algorithm to upsample triangle meshes. It was especially informative to see how the halfEdgemesh
	data structure made traversal, assignment, and other operations both convenient and generalizable!
	The upsampling of meshes is an incredibly powerful tool - being able to turn the low resolution meshes into
	high resolution polygons in seconds with just a few functions was very rewarding.</p>
<h2 id="task-1-triangle-rasterization">Task 1 - Bezier Curves</h2>
<p>In this task, we implemented Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision. De Casteljau's 
	algorithm leverages repeated linear interpolation to create a smooth curve from given control points. These N control points (splines)
	can be moved around as the starting points of N-1 iterations of linear interpolation to create the Bezier Curves.
	</p>
<p>Below is our Bezier curve with 6 control points, starting from level 0 (no interpolation) iteratively to level 5
	(a single interpolated point on the Bezier Curve). </p>
<div>

  <img src="images/task1/task1level1.png" height="300" width="400"/>

</div>

<div>
	<img src="images/task1/task1level3.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task1/task1level4.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task1/task1level5.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  </div>

<p>Below are the same control points and algorithm, but generating the entire Bezier Curve (with intermdiate interpolation for different points shown).
</p>

	<img src="images/task1/task1curve2.png" height="400" width="532"/>
  </div>

<p>Below is another example with 6 control points, moved from their original positions (with and without intermdiate interpolation shown).
</p>

	<img src="images/task1/task1curve5.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  </div>


<h2 id="task-2-supersampling-algorithm">Task 2 - Bezier Surfaces</h2>
<p>In this task, we implemented Bezier Surfaces with the separable 1D de Casteljau algorithm. Given an m by n collection of control points, 
	we first interpolated for a given point across all m points along one dimension (one row) varying parameter u, and then used the resulting interpolated points
	to interpolate points on the actual surface across all n rows by varying parameter v. In this way, we were able to interpolate across three dimensions
	and create a smooth surface efficiently. </p>
<p>Below is the "teapot.bez" rendered using our bezier surface implementation.</p>
<div>
  <img src="images/task2/task2teapot.png" height="450" width="600"/>
</div>


<h2 id="task-3-transforms">Task 3 - Vertex Normal Shading</h2>
<p>In this task, we implemented area-weighted normal vectors for all vertices to more accurately shade triangles with Phong shading. 
	We accomplished this by traversing all the neighboring faces of a vertex, and calculating the approximate
	unit normal at that vertex by weighting its neighboring faces' normals by those faces' area. </p>

<p>Below, you can see the difference between flat shading (by triangle) and Phong shading (interpolation by the vertex
	normals as calculated above) on the "teapot.dae" file.</p>
<div>
	<img src="images/task3/task3teapotbasic.png" height="300" width="450"/>
	<img src="images/task3/task3teapotphong.png" height="300" width="450"/>
</div>
<h2 id="task-4-barycentric-coordinates">Task 4 - Edge Flip</h2>
<p>In this task, we implemented the "edge flip" operation to transform two adjacent triangles ABC and CBD into triangles with the 
	same outer edges ADC and ADB by flipping the connecting edge. This was done using the halfEdgeMesh
	data structure and careful accounting of what pointers within the structure needed reassignment. 
	We preserved the inner edge BC's pointers to related halfedges, basically rotating the two triangles within the confines of
	the outer edges AC, CD, DB, and BA. Thankfully, after a careful examination of every element,
	we didn't need any further debugging tools. </p>

<p>Below, "cow.dae" is rendered as specified by the file, and then after a sequence of edge flips to orient the triangles on the
	face of the mesh the same direction.</p>

<div>
  <img src="images/task4/task4cow1.png" height="400" width="532"/>
  <img src="images/task4/task4cow2.png" height="400" width="532"/>
</div>

<h2 id="task-5-texture-mapping">Task 5 - Edge Split</h2>
<p>In this task, we implemented the "edge split" operation to transform two adjacent triangles ABC and CBD into four
	triangles ACE, CED, BED, and ABE by creating a new vertex e at the midpoint of the edge CB that connected
	the two adjacent triangles ABC and CBD. We did this by creating vertex e, preserving edge CB as 
	edge CE, and creating three new edges (DE, BE, AE) and the corresponding faces and halfedges.</p>

<p>By making sure that edge BC remained intact as edge CE, we were able to preserve traversal techniques and guarantee
	correctness of our edge splits.</p>

<p>Below, "cube.dae" is shown before and after a series of edge splits on its nearest face.</p>
<div>
  <img src="images/task5/task5cube1.png" height="400" width="532"/>
  <img src="images/task5/task5cube2.png" height="400" width="532"/>
</div>

<p>Below, "bean.dae" is shown before and after a series of both edge splits <em>and</em> edge flips.</p>

<div>
	<img src="images/task5/task5bean1.png" height="400" width="532"/>
	<img src="images/task5/task5bean2.png" height="400" width="532"/>
  </div>

<h2 id="task-6-texture-mapping-level-sampling-methods">Task 6 - Mesh Upsampling</h2>
<p>In this task, we utilized the Loop Subdivision algorithm to upsample a mesh. With a series of edge splits and flips 
	across the entire mesh and calculations using vertex neighbors to update positions, this algorithm augments
	a given mesh to render it in more detail (with more triangles). By adding and updating isNew and isOriginal flags to edges and vertices, we were able
	to iterate over all edges and vertices of a mesh and appropriately carry out the upsampling
	algorithm. </p>
<p>Initially, we had an issue where the new position of a vertex created by an edge split was incorrect - causing 
	bizarre artifacts instead of the correct faces touching new vertices. We solved this by transferring the new 
	position at the time of split - not waiting until a later iteration when that vertex's neighboring edge may
	have been flipped or transformed.</p>
<p>Below, Loop Subdivision is performed on the "torus.dae" file, and it can be seen that the polygon's sharp edges
	are gradually smoothed with upsampling. However, their fidelity can be lost if those edges were intentionally 
	sharp. </p>
<div>
  <img src="images/task6/task6torus1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  <img src="images/task6/task6torus2.png" height="300" width="400"/>
  <img src="images/task6/task6torus3.png" height="300" width="400"/>
</div>

<p>However, by pre-splitting the outer edges of "torus.dae", we were able to preserve the corners of the object! Below are the 
	results of the same upsampling done on the object with pre-split edges.</p>

<div>
	<img src="images/task6/task6split1.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task6/task6split2.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	<img src="images/task6/task6split3.png" height="300" width="400"/>
	</div>	

<p>Even for several sequential Loop Subdivisions, the corners are perserved!</p>
<div>
	<img src="images/task6/task6hifidelitysplit4.png" height="400" width="532"/>
</div>

<p>Below, we call Loop Subdivision sequentially on "cube.dae" to smooth the sharp cube into an almost spherical mesh.</p>
<div>
	<img src="images/task6/task6cube0.png" height="200" width="267"/>
	<img src="images/task6/task6cube1.png" height="200" width="267"/>
	<img src="images/task6/task6cube2.png" height="200" width="267"/>
	<img src="images/task6/task6cube3.png" height="200" width="267"/>		
	</div>	

<p>However, splitting the cube with no preprocessing causes asymmetry (two corners protrude more than the others) - and this 
	is because of the degree of each corner vertex! Because of the representation of the face 
	of the cube as 2 triangles, some corners have a higher degree by having more incident edges. Thus, by splitting
	each face into four equal triangles, we can guarantee that each corner vertex has equal degree, and thus are
	processed identically by the upsampling algorithm. In this way, we can guarantee that our mesh
	remains symmetric. </p>

<p>Below is the result of Loop Subdivision given the preprocessing described above.</p>	
<div>
	<img src="images/task6/task6symmetry0.png" height="200" width="267"/>
	<img src="images/task6/task6symmetry1.png" height="200" width="267"/>
	<img src="images/task6/task6symmetry2.png" height="200" width="267"/>
	<img src="images/task6/task6symmetry3.png" height="200" width="267"/>
	</div>	

<h2 id="retrospective-and-thoughts">Retrospective and Takeaways</h2>
<p>In utilizing the halfEdgeMesh data structure to implement procedural upsampling and improved shading and rendering
	of surfaces, it became clear how crucial the data structure is. We thoroughly enjoyed working
	with the data structure, the linear interpolation of smooth surfaces, and algorithmic upsampling.</p>

<p>The understanding of how symmetry and manifold properties can be affected by our transformations is also 
	important, and was illustrated in great detail by this project.</p>
